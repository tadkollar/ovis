""" collections.py
Stores the names of all supported collections as constants. This is a part
of the 3-tier architecture which can be included at any tier (hence the name
'shared')

Constants include:
    CASES, DRIVER_ITERATIONS, DRIVER_METADATA,
    GLOBAL_ITERATIONS, METADATA, SOLVER_ITERATIONS,
    SOLVER_METADATA, SYSTEM_ITERATIONS, SYSTEM_METADATA
